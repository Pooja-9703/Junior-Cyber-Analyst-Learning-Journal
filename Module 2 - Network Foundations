Section 1: Introduction to Networks

This section gave me a foundational understanding of how computer networks enable communication and data exchange between devices.
I learned about:

Nodes and Links: How different devices (nodes) connect and interact through physical or wireless links.

Network Types: The differences between LAN, WAN, and other types of networks, and how they serve various purposes.

Importance of Networks: Why modern systems rely so heavily on connectivity for efficiency and accessibility.

LAN and WAN Integration: How local and wide area networks work together to create scalable infrastructures.

Section 2: Network Concepts

In this section, I explored the key models and protocols that form the backbone of network communication.
I learned about:

OSI and TCP/IP Models: How each model layers communication processes, and how they compare in real-world usage.

Common Network Protocols: Understanding HTTP, FTP, SMTP, TCP, UDP, and IP â€” and the roles they play in data transmission.

Transmission Types, Modes, and Media: How data moves across networks through various physical and logical means.
