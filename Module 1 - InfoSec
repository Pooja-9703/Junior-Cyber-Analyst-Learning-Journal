**Module 1: Introduction to Information Security**

Completed: October 22, 2025
Duration: 3 days

This module provided a strong foundation in the core concepts and structure of information security.
I learned about the fundamental principles that guide the protection of data and systems, the major domains that make up the field, and how different roles and teams work together to defend organizations from cyber threats.

Key Topics Covered:
	•	Structure & Principles: Understood the goals and importance of information security, including confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA triad).
	•	Information Security Domains: Explored areas like network, application, operational, cloud, mobile, IoT, and physical security, along with disaster recovery and business continuity planning.
	•	Common Threats: Learned about DDoS attacks, ransomware, insider threats, social engineering, and advanced persistent threats (APTs).
	•	Cybersecurity Teams: Discovered how red, blue, and purple teams operate, and how threat actors challenge them.
	•	Job Roles: Gained insight into roles such as CISO, penetration tester, SOC, and bug bounty hunter — each contributing differently to cybersecurity defense.

Reflection:
Completing this first module gave me a clear overview of how broad and interconnected cybersecurity truly is. 
I’m looking forward to diving deeper into technical topics and hands-on practices as I progress through the course.
